# forecastHybrid
Convenient functions for ensemble forecasts in R combining approaches from the {forecast} package


Inspired by the idea of taking the approach in 
[http://ellisp.github.io/blog/2016/01/30/hybrid-forecasts/](http://ellisp.github.io/blog/2016/01/30/hybrid-forecasts/)
and expanding into a proper R package.

Very much under construction, don't expect it to work yet.

## Installation

```{r eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("ellisp/forecastHybrid/pkg")
```


## Usage

```{r}
# examples will go here
```
